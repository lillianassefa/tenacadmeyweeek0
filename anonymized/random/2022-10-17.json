    "text": "If you struggle with procrastination, these 5 tips below can help you make progress and stay on track. Remember, sometimes, being aware of the problem can help you take steps to overcome it.\n\u2022 *Set small goals*: The thought of completing one huge task can seem daunting. Having a list of small and achievable goals can help you tackle each one, in turn, meaning that you make gradual progress towards completion.\n\u2022 *Organize your tasks*: The point above feeds into this one. You can stay motivated to accomplish your main goals by creating a precise schedule with dates (daily, weekly and monthly) for when you will achieve each of your smaller goals.\n\u2022  *Focus your attention*: Concentrating on some of the simpler activities you need to complete is another method for overcoming procrastination. This is a major confidence booster to achieve set tasks\n\u2022 *Remove distractions*: They can easily derail your progress, whether it\u2019s having your phone next to you on your desk or having the TV on in the background. Ensure you create a comfortable working environment where distractions can't thrive.\n\u2022 *Forgive yourself*: It's easy to punish yourself for putting off tasks. You might tell yourself that you're being ineffective or lazy. In actuality, doing this to yourself doesn't increase productivity; it just makes you feel more agitated and nervous. So learn to forgive yourself always.\n",
